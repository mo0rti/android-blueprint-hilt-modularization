# Android Blueprints
## Hilt & Modularization

Android blueprints are the latest techs that I'm using in my Android projects and I'll share them here so everyone can use them.

In this repository you'll find:
* Dependency injection using [Hilt]
* A single-activity architecture [Navigation component]
* A multi module structure using [Navigation coordinator]
* An MVI pattern using [Flow]

## Who is it for?

* Intermediate developers are looking for a way to structure their app in a testable and maintainable way.
* Advanced developers looking for quick reference.


## What's next?

This project is still in progress for Intermediate and advanced Android developers.
There is [another repository](https://github.com/mo0rti/android-blueprint-advanced-modularization) which contains the latest practices for multi module projects including feature flags and latest Android navigation patterns
So Stay tuned!!
